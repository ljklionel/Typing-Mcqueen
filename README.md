# Typing-Mcqueen

This is a speed typing game inspired by https://monkeytype.com/ built purely using HTML, CSS and Javascript with no libraries. 

> :warning: **As this is the first (maybe only) version, there are tons of bugs. If it bothers you, ~cry~ please dm me :)**

## Please read the following before attempting:
- The moment you press spacebar, you cannot return to the previous word.
- Backspace only works on the current word.
- It's ok to type slowly.
- This is done using raw HTML, CSS and Javascript so of course it doesn't look as good. (I hate CSS)

If you still want to type notwithstanding the text above, please visit the Github page here [Typing Mcqueen](https://ljklionel.github.io/Typing-Mcqueen/). Happy typing :)
